# react-input-number-editor demo

## To make it works

You'll need to build the library before running the demo.
To do so, run the script build or start in the root project.
The build script build the library once and the start script watch for changes and build.

### Build production library for deployment
```shell
$ cd ..
$ yarn build
$ cd example
$ yarn build
```

### Start the demo with hot reloading
```shell
$ cd ..
$ yarn start
$ cd example
$ yarn start
```

## Available Scripts

In this project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
